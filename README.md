## 8 channel DAQ device
this project was done to meassure stress on the various parts of two wheeler vehicle for testing and verification purpose. Strain gauges are used to meassure stress on the chassis. Strain gauge is a passssive sensor that requires external excitation. strain gauges change their ressisstance when bent or stretched. The strain gauges are placed on a wheatsstone bridge configuration to detect the change in ressistance which is given by the wheatsstone bridge in the form of voltage output.

this change in voltage is very low (in the renge of microvolts to few millivolts). This small change in voltage cannot be measured directly through the microcontroller accurately, so this signal needss to be amplified by an amplifier to the range where the microcontroller or and ADC can read the sisgnal in high resolution. the signal output from the sstrain gauge or load cell is very weak and prone to external noises. in order to amplify this signal an amplifier with high common mode rejection ratio, good EMI filter and built in noise immunity to noisess from the AC source (50 and 60 HZ is required). Depending on the posistion of the strain gauge on the chassis the range of voltage output given is also different and we want to utilize full range of ADC's voltage reading capabilityk, so a programmable amplifier with gain sestting from 1/128 to 128 was sseslected. the amplifier alsso has common mode rejection ratio of 116 DB and buitl in noise rejection for 50 and 60 hz. the amplifier also has safety features for over amplification and input overvoltage protection. after selecting the amplifier a sample test board was dessigned and tessted. this board was designed for tessting the capabilitiess of the amplifier. the designed board can be sseen below.
