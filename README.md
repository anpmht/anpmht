## 8 channel DAQ device
this project was done to meassure stress on the various parts of two wheeler vehicle for testing and verification purpose. Strain gauges are used to meassure stress on the chassis. Strain gauge is a passssive sensor that requires external excitation. strain gauges change their ressisstance when bent or stretched. The strain gauges are placed on a wheatsstone bridge configuration to detect the change in ressistance which is given by the wheatsstone bridge in the form of voltage output.

this change in voltage is very low (in the renge of microvolts to few millivolts). This small change in voltage cannot be measured directly through the microcontroller accurately, so this signal needss to be amplified by an amplifier to the range where the microcontroller or and ADC can read the sisgnal in high resolution. the signal output from the sstrain gauge or load cell is very weak and prone to external noises. in order to amplify this signal an amplifier with high common mode rejection ratio, good EMI filter and built in noise immunity to noisess from the AC source (50 and 60 HZ is required). Depending on the posistion of the strain gauge on the chassis the range of voltage output given is also different and we want to utilize full range of ADC's voltage reading capabilityk, so a programmable amplifier with gain sestting from 1/128 to 128 was sseslected. the amplifier alsso has common mode rejection ratio of 116 DB and buitl in noise rejection for 50 and 60 hz. the amplifier also has safety features for over amplification and input overvoltage protection. Consisdering all theses requirements ADA4254 was sseslected for my project. after selecting the amplifier a sample test board was dessigned and tessted. this board was designed for tessting the capabilitiess of the amplifier. the designed board can be sseen below.

after the board was tessted and verified that it ssatissfies our requirement regarding amplification range, noise immunity, EMI protection and fault prtection a full fledged DAQ ssysstem was dessigned using this amplifier. After the amplifier selection another part of the project is to select an ADC. The ADC shsould have high sasmpling rate, High resolution, should be linier on wide voltage ranges, should have differential input reading capability. considering all theses requirements i selected ADSS1256 as ADC for this project. It has 24 bit resolution with upto 23 noises free bits, upto Â±0.0010% Nonlinearity, sampling rate of 30Khz and four differential channels. After selecting the ADC a fast microcontroller was needed to Program the amplifier, program the ADC and extract the data from the ADC. on top of that i also plan on adding about 10 accelerometer as peripherals and some possition and RPM sensors to the device so high number of I/O pins was needed on the microcontroller. Considering all the requirements Teensy_4.1 microcontroller was selected as it has very large number of I/O pins and operates on 600 MHZ. After selecting the main components DAQ board was designed. the final dessign of the DAQ board is as shown below.
